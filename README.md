# kube-manifests
The repository contains some examples of *.yaml Kubernetes manifests
----------
|Name|Prompt|Description|Example|
|--|--|--|--|
|Create APP| generate nginx deployment yaml manifest. Keep these in mind: When create deployments containers must have resource limits | This manifest creates a deployment with 3 replicas of the Nginx container. The container is configured to listen on port 80, and has resource limits set to 500 millicore (m) of CPU and 512 mebibytes (Mi) of memory. The container also has requests set to 250 millicore of CPU and 256 mebibytes of memory. | [Link](./yaml/app.yaml) |
|Liveness Probe| generate livenessProbe for nginx yaml manifest | This configuration will ensure that the Nginx container is periodically checked for liveness, and if it is found to be unhealthy, Kubernetes will automatically restart it. | [Link](./yaml/app-livenessProbe.yaml) |
|Readiness Probe| generate readinessProbe for nginx yaml manifest | This configuration will create an HTTP GET probe that checks the / endpoint of the Nginx container on port 80 for readiness. The probe will wait for 10 seconds before it starts checking the container's readiness (initialDelaySeconds), and it will perform the check every 5 seconds (periodSeconds). | [Link](./yaml/app-readinessProbe.yaml) |
| Volume mounts | generate volumeMounts for nginx yaml manifest | This configuration will mount a volume named nginx-data to the /var/www/html path inside the Nginx container. | [Link](./yaml/app-volumeMounts.yaml) |
|Cronjob | generate cronjob yaml manifest | This manifest defines a CronJob named helloworld that runs a job every 15 minutes (*/15 * * * *). The job runs a container based on the cronitor/cronitor-php:latest image and runs the command date >> /tmp/date.txt to write the current date and time to a file named date.txt in the container's /tmp directory. The restartPolicy is set to OnFailure, which means that the container will be restarted if it exits with a non-zero exit code. | [Link](./yaml/app-cronjob.yaml) |
| Job | generate job yaml manifest | This manifest defines a Job named hello-world that runs a container based on the alpine:latest image and runs the command echo "Hello World" to print the string "Hello World" to the standard output. The restartPolicy is set to OnFailure, which means that the container will be restarted if it exits with a non-zero exit code. | [Link](./yaml/app-job.yaml) |
|Multi container | generate multi-container yaml manifest | This manifest defines a Job named hello-world that runs a container based on the alpine:latest image and runs the command echo "Hello World" to print the string "Hello World" to the standard output. The restartPolicy is set to OnFailure, which means that the container will be restarted if it exits with a non-zero exit code. | [Link](./yaml/app-multicontainer.yaml)  |
| Resources | generate yaml manifest, containers must have resource limits | In this example, the resources field is used to specify resource limits and requests for the container. The limits field sets the maximum amount of CPU and memory resources that the container can use, while the requests field sets the minimum amount of resources that the container requires. |  [Link](./yaml/app-resources.yaml) |
| Secret Env | generate secret-env yaml manifest | This YAML manifest describes a Kubernetes Pod named app-secret that runs an Nginx container. The Pod is configured to mount a Secret named test-secret as a volume at the path /etc/secret-volume inside the container.| [Link](./yaml/app-secret-env.yaml) |
